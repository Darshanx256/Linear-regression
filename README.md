### Linear Regression
This mini project explores how housing prices can be predicted using basic linear regression. The dataset contains features like area, number of bedrooms, furnishing status, and more. After cleaning the data and converting text to numbers, a regression model is trained to predict prices. The idea is to understand how each feature contributes to the final price and how accurate the model can get using just linear relationships.
